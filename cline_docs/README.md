This directory contains the project documentation organized into focused, single-purpose files for better maintainability and clarity.

## Documentation Structure

### [Product Context](productContext.md)
- Why this project exists
- What problems it solves
- How it should work

### [Active Context](activeContext.md)
- What you're working on now
- Recent changes
- Next steps
(This is your source of truth for current development)

### [System Patterns](systemPatterns.md)
- How the system is built
- Key technical decisions
- Architecture patterns

### [Technical Context](techContext.md)
- Technologies used
- Development setup
- Technical constraints

### [Progress](progress.md)
- What works
- What's left to build
- Progress status

## Using This Documentation

1. For new team members:
   - Start with `productContext.md` to understand the project's purpose
   - Then review `systemPatterns.md` to learn about the technical architecture
   - Finally, check `techContext.md` for setup instructions

2. For active developers:
   - Use `activeContext.md` as your daily reference
   - Keep track of progress in `progress.md`
   - Consult `systemPatterns.md` when making architectural decisions

3. For project planning:
   - Review `progress.md` for current status
   - Check `activeContext.md` for ongoing work
   - Reference `productContext.md` for alignment with project goals

## Documentation Maintenance

Each file serves a specific purpose and should be updated when relevant changes occur:

- Update `activeContext.md` frequently as work progresses
- Update `progress.md` when features are completed or new work is planned
- Update `systemPatterns.md` when architectural decisions are made
- Update `techContext.md` when development requirements change
- Update `productContext.md` when project goals or scope changes
