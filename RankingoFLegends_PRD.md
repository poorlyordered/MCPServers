- Tournament creation and management using Challengermode API
- League scheduling and standings
- Match result tracking and statistics

**Authentication and Backend**

- User registration and login via Supabase
- Email verification and communication
- Data storage for user profiles, teams, and tournament data

### Technology Stack

**Frontend**
Vue.js 3 with TypeScript
Vite for build tooling
Vitest for unit testing
Playwright for end-to-end testing
ESLint + Prettier for code quality
Responsive design for mobile and desktop

**Backend and Services**

2. Implement email verification using Supabase
3. Create player profiles with:
   - Basic info (username, rank, preferred roles)
   - Stats pulled from RIOT API (win rate, KDA, etc.)
   - Team affiliations and availability status

**Team Management**

1. Enable users to create and manage teams
2. Team profiles should include:
   - Team name, logo, and description
   - Roster of current players
   - Team stats (wins, losses, tournament placements)
3. Implement a team search function for players looking to join

**Matchmaking System**

1. Allow players to browse and apply to teams
2. Enable teams to post openings and review player applications
3. Implement filters for rank, roles, and availability

**Tournament and League Organization**

1. Integrate Challengermode API for tournament creation and management
2. Allow users to create and manage leagues with multiple teams
3. Implement a scheduling system for matches
4. Display tournament brackets and league standings
5. Automatically update results and statistics after matches

**Communication**

1. Implement a messaging system for players and teams
2. Set up automated email notifications for important events (match reminders, tournament updates)

### User Interface

- Design a clean, intuitive interface with easy navigation
- Create separate dashboards for players and team managers
- Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop use

### Data Management

- Use Supabase for storing user profiles, team data, and platform-specific information
- Integrate RIOT API for real-time player and game statistics
- Utilize Challengermode API for tournament data and management

### Security and Compliance

1. Implement secure authentication through Supabase
2. Ensure compliance with data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
3. Implement rate limiting and API key management for third-party integrations

### Monetization Strategy

1. Offer premium features for players and teams (advanced stats, priority matching)
2. Charge fees for tournament entry (percentage-based to keep costs low for users)
3. Explore sponsorship opportunities for leagues and tournaments

### Development Approach

To keep costs low and development simple:

1. Utilize no-code/low-code tools where possible (e.g., Supabase Studio for backend management)
2. Focus on integrating existing services rather than building custom solutions
3. Use a modular approach to allow for future expansions and improvements
4. Consider using a website builder like Webflow for the frontend to minimize coding requirements

### Timeline and Milestones

1. Project Setup and Planning (2 weeks)
2. User Authentication and Basic Profiles (3 weeks)
3. Team Management Features (3 weeks)
4. Tournament and League Integration (4 weeks)
5. Matchmaking System (3 weeks)
6. Testing and Refinement (3 weeks)
7. Launch Preparation (2 weeks)

Total estimated timeline: 20 weeks (5 months)

By focusing on integration of existing services and keeping the frontend simple, this project can be developed with minimal technical expertise. However, it's recommended to consult with experienced developers for proper implementation and security measures[1][3][7].
