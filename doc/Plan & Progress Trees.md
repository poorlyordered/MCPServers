- Navigation: Vue Router integration, active state management
- Forms: Form validation, v-model integration, TypeScript types
- Data Display: Chart library integration, table pagination
- Feedback: Vue 3 teleport, state management for notifications

Testing Strategy:
- Unit tests with Vitest
- E2E tests with Playwright
- Visual regression testing for UI components

- [ ] Responsive layout system
