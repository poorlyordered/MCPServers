# Evolution-Aware Design Document
Version: 1.0.1
Last Updated: 2024-01-10

## Overview

This document maintains a record of architectural decisions and design evolution for the Ranking of Legends platform. It serves as a living document to track our technical choices, their rationale, and how they shape the system's growth.

## Current Architecture

### Authentication System
- **Multi-Provider Authentication**
  - Email/Password with OTP verification
  - Social authentication (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Discord)
  - Session management with Supabase
  - Secure token handling and storage

### Frontend Architecture
- **Vue 3 with TypeScript**
  - Composition API for better type inference and code organization
  - Script setup syntax for cleaner component code
  - Type-safe component props and events

- **State Management**
  - Pinia for centralized state
  - Modular store design with separate stores for authentication, user data, and application state
  - Composable functions for reusable logic

- **Routing**
  - Vue Router with typed routes
  - Nested route structure following feature hierarchy
  - Route guards for authentication and authorization
  - OAuth callback handling

- **Component Structure**
  - Atomic design pattern
  - Feature-based organization
  - Shared components in common directory
  - Strict props typing and validation
  - Loading states and error handling

### Backend Integration
- **Supabase Implementation**
  - Authentication with email and social providers
  - OAuth integration with multiple providers
  - PostgreSQL database with RLS policies
  - Real-time subscriptions for live updates
  - Edge Functions for serverless operations

- **API Integration**
  - RIOT API for game data
  - Type-safe API clients
  - Request caching and rate limiting
  - Error handling and retry logic

### Development Tooling
- **Build System**
  - Vite for fast development and optimized builds
  - ESBuild for TypeScript transpilation
  - Asset optimization and code splitting

- **Code Quality**
  - ESLint with TypeScript rules
  - Prettier for consistent formatting
  - Husky for pre-commit hooks
  - Vitest for unit testing
  - Playwright for E2E testing

## Historical Design Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

#### ADR 1: Vue 3 + TypeScript (2023-12-15)
- **Context**: Need for a modern, type-safe frontend framework
- **Decision**: Chose Vue 3 with TypeScript over React or Angular
- **Rationale**:
  - Strong typing support
  - Composition API for better code organization
  - Excellent developer experience
  - Growing ecosystem

#### ADR 2: Supabase Backend (2023-12-20)
- **Context**: Need for a scalable backend solution
- **Decision**: Selected Supabase over Firebase or custom backend
- **Rationale**:
  - PostgreSQL database with powerful features
  - Built-in authentication and authorization
  - Real-time capabilities
  - Cost-effective scaling

#### ADR 3: Pinia State Management (2024-01-05)
- **Context**: Need for robust state management
- **Decision**: Migrated from Vuex to Pinia
- **Rationale**:
  - Better TypeScript support
  - Simpler API
  - Devtools integration
  - Module system that scales well

#### ADR 4: Multi-Step Authentication Flow (2024-01-10)
- **Context**: Need for secure and flexible user registration
- **Decision**: Implemented multi-step authentication with profile creation
- **Rationale**:
  - Better user experience with progressive profile completion
  - Support for multiple authentication providers
  - Secure session management
  - Scalable user verification process

### Design Evolution

#### Initial Design (2023-12-15)
- Basic Vue 3 setup
- Simple component structure
- Local state management

#### First Iteration (2023-12-20)
- Added TypeScript configuration
- Implemented basic routing
- Set up Supabase integration

#### Second Iteration (2024-01-10)
- Comprehensive authentication system
- Multi-step registration flow
- Profile creation and verification
- Social login integration

## Role-Based Evolution

### Individual Level Evolution
1. **Unverified Player â†’ Verified Player**
   - Initial registration with basic profile
   - RIOT account verification process
   - Access to basic features
   - Progression to full platform features
