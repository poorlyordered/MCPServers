## Overview

This document maintains a record of architectural decisions and design evolution for the Ranking of Legends platform. It serves as a living document to track our technical choices, their rationale, and how they shape the system's growth.

## Current Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Vue 3 with TypeScript**
  - Composition API for better type inference and code organization
  - Script setup syntax for cleaner component code
  - Type-safe component props and events

- **State Management**
  - Pinia for centralized state
  - Modular store design with separate stores for authentication, user data, and application state
  - Composable functions for reusable logic

- **Routing**
  - Vue Router with typed routes
  - Nested route structure following feature hierarchy
  - Route guards for authentication and authorization

- **Component Structure**
  - Atomic design pattern
  - Feature-based organization
  - Shared components in common directory
  - Strict props typing and validation

### Backend Integration
- **Supabase Implementation**
  - Authentication with email and social providers
  - PostgreSQL database with RLS policies
  - Real-time subscriptions for live updates
  - Edge Functions for serverless operations

- **API Integration**
  - RIOT API for game data
  - Type-safe API clients
  - Request caching and rate limiting
  - Error handling and retry logic

### Development Tooling
- **Build System**
  - Vite for fast development and optimized builds
  - ESBuild for TypeScript transpilation
  - Asset optimization and code splitting

- **Code Quality**
  - ESLint with TypeScript rules
  - Prettier for consistent formatting
  - Husky for pre-commit hooks
  - Vitest for unit testing
  - Playwright for E2E testing
